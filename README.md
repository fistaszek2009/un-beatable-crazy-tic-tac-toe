Can simple tic-tac-toe game become *crazy coding adventure*? Of course! I have created realistic version of this game, where you can literally **draw your sign** and then try to beat (un)beatable **minimax bot**. One of the unexpected gameplay features is an opportunity to *"change" your sign while playing*. Do not be obvious with sign proper order, draw X when it is O's time! Make bot dizzy.
